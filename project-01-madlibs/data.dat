Jack was on his way to college until he spotted something from 
the conner of my eye. Hewas very curious and he went closer
to see what it was. As he got closer he saw a little fluffy 
white tale. When he got to the conner he saw a little cute 
baby cat with blue eyes. But the cat started to run away. So,
Jack ran to follow were it was going. As he followed the cat
there was another shine portal at the end of the wall. He
walked in and saw a land of grass and the cat running twords
the water. As he approched the cat it started talking to him 
which startled he and make him jump. The cat was telling him 
something important but them he woke up and screamed.
