Jack was on his way to college until he spotted something from 
the conner of my eye. Hewas very curious and he went closer
to see what it was. As he got closer he saw a little fluffy 
white tale. When he got to the conner he saw a little cute 
baby cat with blue eyes. But the cat started to run away. So,
Jack ran to follow were it was going. As he followed the cat
there was another shine portal at the end of the wall. He
walked in and saw a land of grass and the cat running twords
the water. As he approched the cat it started talking to him 
which startled he and started to run twords he portal. 

But the cat told Jack "don't run you wont find the portal
I have closed it". Jack started to yell at the cat trying
to understand why he did that. So, the cat told him to breath
and that he woudl explain something to him.

The cat went on telling him that we have gotten you here to 
tell you something important. You have been selected to join
the secoret cat enforcement to help safe the world from 
distruction. And Jack started to laugh so hard and fell down 
from his bed and woke up. The first thing he sees when he wakes 
up was the cat with a white tale and blue eyes.
